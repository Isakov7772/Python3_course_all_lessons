And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, be fashionable and be successful. Without advertising, life is boring and colourless."

Advertisers know we love our children and want to give them everything. So they use children’s ‘pester power’ to sell their products. Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must be rules. Some adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste their money."
